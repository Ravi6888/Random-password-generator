Random Password Generator

A simple Python script to generate strong random passwords, helping you quickly create secure credentials for accounts and applications.

	Features

•	Generates a random password of user-specified length.

•	The password includes uppercase letters, lowercase letters, digits and special characters to enhance security.

•	Easy to use: just run the script and follow the prompt.

•	No external dependencies beyond Python’s standard library.

	Tech Stack / Requirements

•	Language: Python (tested with Python 3.x)

•	Libraries: only built-in modules (string, random, etc)

•	Operating System: Platform-agnostic (Windows, macOS, Linux) as long as Python is installed.

	How to Run / Execute the Project

1.	Clone this repository:
2.	git clone https://github.com/Ravi6888/Random-password-generator.git
3.	cd Random-password-generator
4.	Make sure you have Python 3 installed:
5.	python3 --version
6.	Run the script:
7.	python3 Random_password_generator.py
8.	When prompted, enter the desired length of password (e.g., 12) and press Enter.
9.	The script outputs a randomly generated password of that length.

	Usage Example

$ python3 Random_password_generator.py

Feel free to copy the generated password and use it wherever you need a strong credential.

	Customization Ideas

•	Add options for excluding similar‐looking characters (e.g., “0” vs “O”, “1” vs “l”).

•	Include a command-line flag interface (e.g., --length=20, --no-symbols).

•	Save generated passwords (securely!) to a file or clipboard.

•	Build a GUI or web interface around it for non-terminal users.
